# Central CI repository

Collection of workflows, configs and other CI related files used by multiple repositories.
It allows me to not have all the "renovate updated x ci job" commits in my other repositories.

Feel free to use it as inspiration for your own setup, but i would not use it directly for yourself, as i might change it without warning.
